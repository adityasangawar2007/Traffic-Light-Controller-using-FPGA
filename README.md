# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-FPGA
The project is about creating a Traffic Light State Machine that handles traffic and pedestrian crossing
If there are no pedestrians, the traffic light is defaut green.
The value only change when there is an input from the pedestrian or a hard reset.
We snthesized the hardware on Altera Cyclone II FPGA board using Quartus II.
